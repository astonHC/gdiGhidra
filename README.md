# gdiGhidra
SEGA Dreamcast GDI parsing tool for GHIDRA

# The motive:

The motive behind this project is to create a reverse-engineering toolkit for the NSA's [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)
to allow me to parse contents from the SEGA Dreamcast's prepriatory file type called GDI (or GDRom).

The toolkit will allow emulated talk between the decompiler and the Binary of the GDi file to be able to decompile to the lowest form factor.
Whereby that Binary has been converted to ASM of the decompiler's reccomendation (typically Intel 8086)
